*** 

This vignette discusses how to add a new model family to [`ramp.library`](https://github.com/dd-harp/ramp.library) that can be used by  [`ramp.xde`](https://github.com/dd-harp/ramp.xde). This vignette covers models of parasite infection dynamics and immunity in humans or other hosts -- the dynamical components we have denoted $\cal MYZ.$

Needs to be done.
