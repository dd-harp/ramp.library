The `macdonald` module was included in **`ramp.xds`** for historical reasons: Macdonald's model for mosquito infection dynamics is a special case. What I am calling *Macdonald's Model* comes from three publications in 1952-1953. In 1952, George Macdonald published [*The analysis of the sporozoite rate*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14958825/)^[The analysis of the sporozoite rate. Macdonald G (1952). Trop Dis Bull 49(6):569-86.].  Later that year, in  [*The analysis of equilibrium in malaria*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12995455/)^[The analysis of equilibrium in malaria. Macdonald G (1952). Trop Dis Bull 49(9):813-29.], Macdonald presented a formula for the *basic reproduction rate* of malaria parasites, now often called $R_0$ (pronounced R-naught). Macdonald gives credit to his colleague Armitage for the mathematics. Armitage's paper, [*A note on the epidemiology of malaria*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13113672/)^[A note on the epidemiology of malaria. Armitage P (1953). Trop Dis Bull 50(10):890-2] would appear in 1953, but it was not presented as a system of differential equations. 

The module called *`macdonald`* was included in **`ramp.library`** as an example of a module that was *not* extensible. The model was formulated as a system of delay diferential equations, and the formulation of the *non-autonomous* model (*e.g.* with forcing due to weather or vector control) requires some mathematics. This is, perhaps, why compartment models are so commonly used.  A fully extensible delay differential equation model that extends Macdonald's model is the generalized, non-autonomous Ross-Macdonald module `GeRM.`

In the following, we present a version of Macdonald's model. Next, we present an extension of Macdonald's model that is extensible, published by Joan Aron and Robert M. May in 1982. Finally, we present `macdonald` as an *autonomous* spatial version of Macdonald's model.  

## Macdonald's Model

If Macdonald's analysis were presented as a mathematical model, it would almost certainly look something like the following. Consider
a simple system of differential equations the sporozoite rate has three parameters and one term: 

+ the human blood feeding rate, $a$

+ the extrinsic incubation period, $\tau$  

+ the mosquito death rate, $g$; or the probability of surviving one day, $p=e^{-g}$, so $g=-\ln p$  

+ the fraction of bites on humans that infect a mosquito, $\kappa$ 

Let $y$ denote the fraction of mosquitoes that are infected. The dynamics are given by:
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = a \kappa (1-y) - g y$$ 
Let $z$ denote the fraction of mosquitoes that are infectious. The model is a delay differential equation. Let $y_\tau$ denote the value of $y$ at time $t-\tau.$ If the parameters and terms are constant, then:  
$$\frac{dz}{dt} = e^{-g\tau} a \kappa (1-y_\tau) - g z$$ 
The model has a steady state for the fraction infected: 
$$\bar y = \frac{a \kappa} {a \kappa + g}$$ 
The fraction infectious, also called the sporozoite rate, is 
$$\bar z = \frac{a \kappa} {a \kappa + g}e^{-g\tau}.$$ 
Macdonald used $p$ so his formula was: 
$$\bar z = \frac{a \kappa} {a \kappa -\ln p}e^{-p\tau}$$ 

To generate the formula for $R_0,$ Macdonald introduces another variable and three additional parameters: 

+ the ratio of mosquitoes to humans, $m$ 

+ the rate infections clear, $r$ 

+ the fraction of infectious bites that infect a human, $b$ 

The fraction of infected and infectious humans, $x,$ is given by the equation: 

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = m a z (1-y) - r x$$
and the model assumes that $\kappa = x.$ The formula for $R_0$ in this system is:
$$R_0 = \frac{m b a^2}{gr} e^{-g\tau} = \frac{m b a^2}{(-\ln p)r} e^{-p\tau}$$ 
In this form, the model is difficult to use or extend. 

## Aron & May  

The mosquito module in **`ramp.xds`** called `macdonald` is based on a model first published in 1982 by Joan Aron and Robert May^[The population dynamics of malaria. In *The Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases: Theory and Applications,* R. M. Anderson, ed. (Springer US), pp. 139â€“179. [online](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-2901-3_5){target="_blank"}]. It includes state variables for total mosquito density $M$, infected mosquito density $Y$, and infectious mosquito density $Z$. In this model, the blood feeding rate is split into an overall blood feeding rate, $f$, and the human fraction, $q$ such that $$a=fq.$$ The Aron & May's equations are: 
$$\begin{array}{rl} 
\frac{dM}{dt} &= \Lambda(t) - g M \\
\frac{dY}{dt} &= fq\kappa(M-Y) - g Y \\
\frac{dZ}{dt} &= e^{-g\tau}fq\kappa_\tau(M_\tau-Y_\tau) - g Z \\
\end{array}$$

## `macdonald`  

The module called `macdonald` has been extended beyond the Aron & May formulation to include spatial dynamics and parity. To formulate the spatial model, a spatial domain is sub-divided into a set of patches. Variable and parameter names do not change, but they can now represent vectors of length $n_p.$ To formulate the *demographic matrix,* denoted $\Omega,$ that describes mosquito mortality, emigration, and other loss from the system. We let $\sigma$ denote the emigration rate and $\cal K$ the mosquito dispersal matrix. We also introduce a parameter, $\mu$ to model the fraction of mosquitoes that are lost to emigration from each patch. 
$$\Omega = \mbox{diag} \left(g\right) + \left(\mbox{diag} \left(1-\mu\right)  - \cal K\right) \cdot \mbox{diag} \left(\sigma\right) 
$$

### Dynamics

$$\begin{array}{rl}
\dot{M} & = \Lambda - \Omega\cdot M  \\
\dot{P} & = \mbox{diag}(f) \cdot (M-P) -  \Omega \cdot P\\ 
\dot{Y} & = \mbox{diag}(fq\kappa) \cdot (M-Y) - \Omega \cdot Y \\
\dot{Z} & = 
\dot{Z} = e^{-\Omega \tau} \cdot \mbox{diag}(fq\kappa_{t-\tau}) \cdot (M_{t-\tau}-Y_{t-\tau}) - \Omega \cdot Z
\end{array}
$$

## Ordinary Differential Equations

We note that the module `SI` provides a reasonably simple approximating model that has no delay, but in computing $fqZ,$ it includes mortality and dispersal that would have occurred during the EIP: 
$$
Z = e^{-\Omega \tau} \cdot Y 
$$
The implementation of `SI` is similar in spirit to the simple model presented in  Smith & McKenzie (2004)^[Smith, D.L., Ellis McKenzie, F. Statics and dynamics of malaria infection in Anopheles mosquitoes. Malar J 3, 13 (2004). [online](https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-3-13){target="_blank"}]. in that mortality and dispersal over the EIP is accounted for, but the time lag is not. While
transient dynamics of the ODE model will not equal the DDE model, they have the same
equilibrium values, and so for numerical work requiring finding equilibrium points, the faster
ODE model can be safely substituted.


## Steady States

There are two logical ways to begin solving the non-trivial equilibrium. The first
assumes $\Lambda$ is known, which implies good knowledge of mosquito ecology. The
second assumes $Z$ is known, which implies knowledge of the biting rate on the
human population. We show both below.

### Starting with $\Lambda$

Given $\Lambda$ we can solve:

$$
M = \Omega^{-1} \cdot \Lambda
$$
Then given $M$ we set $\dot{Y}$ to zero and factor out $Y$ to get:

$$
Y = (\mbox{diag}(fq\kappa) + \Omega)^{-1} \cdot \mbox{diag}(fq\kappa) \cdot M
$$
We set $\dot{Z}$ to zero to get:

$$
Z = \Omega^{-1} \cdot e^{-\Omega \tau} \cdot \mbox{diag}(fq\kappa) \cdot (M-Y)
$$

Because the dynamics of $P$ are independent of the infection dynamics, we can solve it given $M$ as:

$$
P = (\Omega + \mbox{diag}(f))^{-1} \cdot \mbox{diag}(f) \cdot M
$$

### Starting with $Z$

It is more common that we start from an estimate of $Z$, perhaps derived from an estimated EIR (entomological inoculation rate). Given $Z$, we can calculate the other state variables and $\Lambda$. For numerical implementation, note that $(e^{-\Omega\tau})^{-1} = e^{\Omega\tau}$.

$$
M-Y = \mbox{diag}(1/fq\kappa) \cdot (e^{-\Omega\tau})^{-1} \cdot \Omega \cdot Z
$$

$$
Y = \Omega^{-1} \cdot \mbox{diag}(fq\kappa) \cdot (M-Y)
$$

$$
M = (M - Y) + Y
$$

$$
\Lambda = \Omega \cdot M
$$
We can use the same equation for $P$ as above.
