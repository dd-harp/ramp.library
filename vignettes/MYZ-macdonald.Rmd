In 1952, George Macdonald published [*The analysis of the sporozoite rate*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14958825/).  Later that year, in  [*The analysis of equilibrium in malaria*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12995455/), Macdonald presented a formula for the *basic reproduction rate* of malaria parasites, now often called $R_0$ (pronounced R-naught). We have included a version of that model, called *`macdonald`* in **`ramp.library`** for several reasons. For a longer discussion, see the [overview](MYZ-Overview.html). 

## Before Macdonald

Before Macdonald, Ross had published mathematical models describing the coupled dynamics of parasite infections in mosquitoes and humans.
